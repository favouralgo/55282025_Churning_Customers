## Problem

Customer churn is a significant problem and one of the most essential concerns for large companies. Due to the direct effect on the companies' revenues, especially in the telecom field, companies seek to develop means to predict potential customer churn. Therefore, finding factors that increase customer churn is vital to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. The main contribution of your work is to develop a churn prediction model that assists telecom operators in predicting customers who are most likely subject to churn. Perform the following operations as you create the much-needed deep-learning application.

**Solution:** A churn prediction model that helps determine if a particular customer will churn or not.
